    "text": "{\"Rapido\": \"Rapido is a novel early-stage prototyping tool to create fully interactive mobile AR prototypes from non-interactive video prototypes using Programming by Demonstration. In Rapido, designers use a mobile AR device to record a video prototype to capture context, sketch assets, and demonstrate interactions. They can demonstrate touch inputs, animation paths, and rules to, e.g., have a sketch follow the focus area of the device or the userâ€™s world-space touches.\", \n\"programming\": \"Programming is the process of performing a particular computation (or more generally, accomplishing a specific computing result), usually by designing and building an executable computer program. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms.\", \n\"usability\": \"Usability can be described as the capacity of a system to provide a condition for its users to perform the tasks safely, effectively, and efficiently while enjoying the experience.\"}",
