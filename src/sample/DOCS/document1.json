    "summary": "The article discusses the increasing use of drones by hobbyist pilots and private organizations in search and rescue missions, despite concerns from some SAR officials. The article focuses on the organization SWARM, which has grown rapidly in membership and reputation for its involvement in SAR missions. The article highlights the need for best practices and guidelines for the use of drones in SAR, and discusses the efforts of SWARM to promote the technology and enforce FAA laws through its code of ethics and assessment process for pilots. The article also provides background information on Jim Bowers, a member of SWARM who is an enthusiast of drone technology and has used his fleet of drones for SAR missions as well as creating videos and art installations.",
