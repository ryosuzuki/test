    "text": "We present a data-driven approach to augmented math textbooks that enables non-technical users to create interactive materials. We introduce 6 augmentation techniques for AR math textbooks and evaluate them through two user studies with 12 participants and expert interviews with 4 math instructors. Our results suggest that our approach makes more engaging and fun experience compared to web interfaces and is appreciated by math teachers due to its on-demand authoring capabilities.",
